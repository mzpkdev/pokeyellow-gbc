# Overworld verification plan

This file is the sole requirement-to-check index. It defines future checks and
the evidence that implementation and baseline verification must produce; it does
not claim that inventories, measurements, ROMs, or test artifacts already
exist. The [prerequisite suite](prerequisite-gates.md) must be operational
before renderer work starts, and the
[AI harness](ai-iteration-harness.md) runs the checks in the tiers below.

## Check definitions

- **CHK-OWN-01:** Method: seeded owner/phase/generation model sequences plus owner-gated writer traces; tier: fast/full; evidence: semantic snapshots, decoded trace, mutation result, seed, and reduced action sequence.
- **CHK-SELECT-01:** Method: enumerate the explicit Cartesian product `{COLOR, YELLOW}` × `{ordinary map presentation, overlay, dialogue, menu, battle, standalone, boot/reset}` × `{each of 34 supported OVERWORLD maps, each of 162 supported interior maps, unsupported map}` without pruning inapplicable-looking cells; tier: fast/full; evidence: all 2,758 pure-resolver rows, including every forced context across the supported 19-interior-tileset slice and unsupported cases, with exactly one owner per cell and a mutation proving preference cannot authorize a write. The expanded harness execution and its evidence are deferred and are not claimed by the current implementation slice.
- **CHK-SELECT-02:** Method: recompute policy before each destination's first owner-gated writer and exercise same-owner and changed-owner cases in both directions; tier: focused/full; evidence: preference/write trace, owner/generation trace, cancellation reason, reconstruction ledger, and exactly one barrier per real handoff.
- **CHK-PROD-01:** Method: inspect normal, debug, and VC source/symbol/callgraph reachability and run the bounded scene matrix across the 34 supported `OVERWORLD` maps and 162 maps using the 19 admitted interior tilesets; tier: fast/focused/full; evidence: exact supported-map gate, forced-Yellow traces, unreachable `OVERWORLD_OVERLAY`, and no production audit carrier. Expanded harness execution is deferred, so the current slice claims build/source/symbol reachability only, not scene-matrix evidence.
- **CHK-REQUEST-01:** Method: runtime pressure for exactly the selected policy of each request class plus schema/reference-model coverage of unselected enum branches; tier: fast/full; evidence: selected capacity/policy table, required-work defer/retry trace, optional-or-supersedable final-rejection fallback where selected, work accounting, and reduced seed.
- **CHK-JOB-01:** Method: handoff, reset, supersession, stale-generation, and adversarial cancellation sequences; tier: fast/full; evidence: job-state and cancellation trace proving no post-cancellation write.
- **CHK-COMMIT-01:** Method: force insufficient budget at every pre-visible preparation/revalidation boundary, verify deferral before `COMMITTING`, and verify uninterrupted completion after worst-case budget reservation; tier: focused/full; evidence: old/new semantic snapshots, frame strip, commit-unit/writer IDs, boundary defer traces, reservation record, and inactive-or-LCD-off interruption cases.
- **CHK-RETURN-01:** Method: for every concrete Yellow-to-Color eligible-map boundary, poison every destination resource and reconstruct from fresh logical authority; tier: focused/full; evidence: concrete directed scene IDs, poison record, reconstruction-item ledger, exactly one presentation barrier, and five active-frame snapshots.
- **CHK-OVERLAY-01:** Method: independent request-data oracle across authoritative BG/window destination, map/tileset identity, nonsingular world transform, override set, clipping mappings, classification, and full-byte precedence; tier: fast/focused/full; evidence: complete causal request fixture, canonical clipped source-index/destination/world mapping records, independently derived tile and attribute bytes, structural proof for each matrix case, and trace proving no VRAM or ambient-map oracle read.
- **CHK-OAM-01:** Method: derive missing, out-of-range, and unmapped fallback classification from final-picture identity plus one corpus-level authoritative mapped-identity set shared by every OAM case under diagnostic and release builds; tier: fast/focused; evidence: corpus-authority consistency/completeness validation, occurred/kind/identity/generation/writer, final tile, before/after attributes, palette-0 result, diagnostic fallback record, and release-symbol audit.
- **CHK-TIME-01:** Method: named instruction-path cycle equations for every selector-activated operation, each with natural budget/deadline, exact-fit case, and exact threshold-plus-one case; tier: focused/full; evidence: completed timing row, equation result, exact-fit commit, whole-unit defer trace, and timing artifact key.
- **CHK-INV-01:** Method: reconcile source search with symbol-guided built-ROM disassembly for the initial map-entry slice and every later declared implementation slice; tier: fast/full; evidence: reviewed `WR-…`, `SC-…`, and `MU-…` rows, before-reachability review, slice closure report, visible out-of-slice backlog, and unlisted-writer/scene/mutation fixtures.
- **CHK-TRACE-01:** Method: validate authority definitions, references, and bidirectional primary mappings; tier: fast; evidence: machine-readable mapping report and zero unknown, uncovered, duplicate, or orphan IDs.
- **CHK-EVIDENCE-01:** Method: execute independent full-color evidence captures against the same debug ROM and compare every stable artifact byte-for-byte; tier: fast/full; evidence: comparison summary, semantic snapshot, traceability report, visual manifest, images, and retained diagnostics.
- **CHK-BUILD-01:** Method: reproducibly build release, debug, and VC variants with warnings fatal; tier: fast/full; evidence: commands, tool versions, ROM content IDs, headers, symbols, link maps, and warning logs.
- **CHK-CGB-01:** Method: exercise CGB hard boot, DMG/SGB rejection, soft reset, and double-speed initialization; tier: fast/full; evidence: header bytes, startup traces, reset snapshots, and rejection-path checkpoints.
- **CHK-BANK-01:** Method: invoke renderer paths from non-default ROM/VRAM banks, every selected renderer WRAM bank, every other valid WRAM entry bank, and interrupt boundaries; tier: fast/focused/full; evidence: before/after bank, stack, interrupt, owner, generation, and dirty-state snapshots.
- **CHK-ROM-01:** Method: inspect source, link maps, and donor adaptations for prohibited banks and MBC1 assumptions; tier: fast/full; evidence: placement decision record, link-map ranges, far-call audit, and negative source/disassembly findings.
- **CHK-PALETTE-01:** Method: compare base, transformed, and hardware BG/OBJ palettes through every remap/effect and owner-dispatched wrapper; tier: focused/full; evidence: palette snapshots, wrapper trace, complete-payload commit record, and visual checkpoints.
- **CHK-TRANSFER-01:** Method: exercise every concrete paired-transfer mutation and destination from the closed baseline and atomically extended inventories; tier: focused/full; evidence: concrete mutation/writer IDs, renewed source/ROM closure, tile/attribute byte pairs, serialization trace, and five-frame boundary captures.
- **CHK-TILESET-01:** Future/non-gating method: audit and exercise all 25 tilesets, table assertions, graphics, roofs, overrides, animations, and native Beach House data; tier: full; evidence: table lengths, assignment audit, semantic atlas, animation captures, and reviewed visual atlas. Bounded-release use includes the admitted outdoor/conventional-interior tables but does not claim all-25 closure or harness coverage for the expanded interiors.
- **CHK-HANDOFF-01:** Method: execute every concrete changed-owner edge in both directions plus reset and soft reset from Color, and every same-owner edge; tier: focused/full; evidence: close/cancel/generation/select/reconstruct/barrier/reopen ordering, destination-resource unknown/poison ledger, complete fresh destination reconstruction ledger, exactly one generation and barrier per changed owner, admission reopening only afterward, zero generation for same owner, bank/interrupt restoration, hidden-display proof where used, normal-boot re-entry after soft reset, and first-writer trace.
- **CHK-OAM-02:** Method: exercise player, follower, every mapped object class, maximum population, shadow construction, sort/copy, invalidation, and one hardware DMA; tier: focused/full; evidence: concrete writer/mutation IDs, final-picture mapping, shadow/hardware OAM snapshots, DMA trace, and frame strip.
- **CHK-VISUAL-01:** Method: inspect named screenshots, bounded frame strips, annotated contact sheets, and localized image diffs beside semantic state; tier: fast/focused/full; evidence: versioned manifest, reviewer result, image diffs, snapshots, and linked traces.
- **CHK-STRESS-01:** Method: repeat simultaneous scrolling, animation, palette, maximum representative OAM, and interrupt pressure; tier: focused/full; evidence: request accounting, semantic snapshots, writer trace, bank snapshots, numeric timing rows, and reviewed frame strips.

- **CHK-STRESS-03:** Method: force insufficient budget at every pre-visible connection-transfer boundary and interrupt mid-operation only for inactive or LCD-off destinations; tier: focused/full; evidence: concrete mutation/writer IDs, old/new snapshots, pre-commit defer traces, reserved-budget completion, bank state, timing row, and frame strip.
- **CHK-REMOVE-01:** Method: source plus built-ROM reachability audit for obsolete competing ownership, restoration, and transitional paths while proving required Yellow paths remain; tier: full; evidence: deleted/unreachable concrete inventory rows, retained forced-Yellow reachability, negative disassembly findings, and adapter disposition report.
- **CHK-REGRESS-01:** Method: run baseline-equivalence scenarios for Yellow preference and every forced-Yellow lifecycle/resource path in normal, debug, and VC products; tier: focused/full; evidence: concrete scene IDs, semantic and visual comparisons, build variants, and regression logs.
- **CHK-CANARY-01:** Method: exercise all eight diagnostic canary palette slots and selected tile classes and audit release exclusion; tier: fast/focused; evidence: semantic palette/tile snapshots, screenshots, debug trace, and release source/symbol findings.

### Checker execution modes

| Mode | Input evidence | What a pass proves | Acceptance effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `synthetic_checker_self_test` | independently authored `SCHEMA_FIXTURE` snapshots and traces | the named checker accepts its positive contract case and rejects its named corruptions | none |
| `rom_runtime` | `RENDERER_RUNTIME` snapshots and traces from a declared nonzero activation phase | the activated renderer path matches the independent oracle | contributes evidence only to the named activated `CHK-…` and mapped acceptance rows |

The mode is recorded in every conformance report and manifest. A synthetic
result cannot be promoted, relabelled, or aggregated as runtime evidence.
Synthetic inputs may contain only causal initial state, actions, and request
configuration. Exact results—including job completion/cancellation,
reconstruction ledgers and barriers, and fallback kind—must be derived. The
case parser rejects missing primary check IDs and check IDs unrelated to the
selected operation before a report can be produced.

## Requirement-to-evidence traceability

Each row has one primary requirement. Cross-reference cells contain only
defined concrete IDs.

## Numeric timing operation matrix

Future execution creates one complete numeric row for every row below before
that operation becomes production-reachable. Each row records every exact
instruction path and its expanded cycle equation, operation, mode, ROM,
tool/device, samples, worst cycles, instrumentation cycles, numeric budget or
deadline, start, guard, margin cycles, margin percent, exact defer threshold,
equation result, insufficient-budget injection at every
pre-visible preparation/revalidation boundary, and the threshold-plus-one
whole-unit defer artifact. For a visible destination it also records
worst-case reservation and uninterrupted completion after `COMMITTING`.
Arbitrary mid-operation interruption appears only for inactive destinations or
LCD-off cases. Repeated measurements retain phase and ROM identity. A row with
a placeholder equation, budget, or deadline grants no activation credit.

## Directed scene and reconstruction matrix

Each implementation phase expands this matrix for the lifecycles and directed
transitions it touches, then reruns source plus built-ROM slice closure before
the changed path becomes reachable. A lifecycle row is never expanded into assumed map entry and
return edges. Grouping aliases is forbidden unless the reviewed inventory
proves identical control flow and names every alias. A representative
fast-tier sample cannot close a full-tier row.

| Directed coverage | Required concrete inventory join | Destination evidence | Reconstruction evidence | Check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| hard boot, reset, soft reset, new-game, and continue into Yellow lifecycles | one `STANDALONE` row plus each concrete Yellow-owned edge | Yellow selected and completely reconstructed before presentation | reset/soft reset from Color includes hidden-display/admission proof, complete fresh Yellow ledger, exactly one barrier, timing evidence, and soft-reset normal-boot re-entry | CHK-HANDOFF-01, CHK-STRESS-02, CHK-TIME-01, CHK-REGRESS-01 |
| overlay, dialogue, menus, battle, status, Pokédex, town map, trainer card, naming, PC, evolution, Hall of Fame, trade, slots, printer, link, Pikachu pictures, Beach, and Surfing Pikachu lifecycles | one row per reachable lifecycle | Yellow owns initialization and display; `OVERWORLD_OVERLAY` unreachable | Color departure completes Yellow reconstruction and barrier | CHK-HANDOFF-01, CHK-PROD-01, CHK-REGRESS-01 |
| Yellow-to-Yellow nesting, return, failure, disconnect, and error recovery | one concrete directed Yellow-owned `SC-…` row per edge | Yellow remains selected; no generation handoff | none | CHK-HANDOFF-01, CHK-REGRESS-01 |
| each effective Color-to-Yellow edge | one concrete directional `SCENE_BOUNDARY` row | Yellow selected before destination initialization entry | poison, complete fresh Yellow reconstruction, one barrier | CHK-HANDOFF-01, CHK-STRESS-02 |
| each effective Yellow-to-Color eligible-map edge | one concrete directional `SCENE_BOUNDARY` row joined to its actual source lifecycle | Color selected before reconstruction | poison, every reconstruction item, one barrier, five active frames | CHK-HANDOFF-01, CHK-RETURN-01 |
| Pallet↔Route 1 while preference is Color, and all Yellow-to-Yellow edges | one reviewed concrete row | owner and generation unchanged | no synthetic handoff, generation, reconstruction, or barrier | CHK-SELECT-02, CHK-HANDOFF-01 |
| every lifecycle or directed edge activated by an implementation phase | one reviewed concrete row plus renewed source/ROM slice closure | evidence follows the effective owner transition | reconstruction for every real owner change in either direction | CHK-INV-01, CHK-HANDOFF-01, CHK-RETURN-01 |

Every actual Yellow-to-Color row records its actual Yellow-owned source
lifecycle and poisons prior bank-0 tilemaps, bank-1 attributes, BG and OBJ
palette RAM, shadow and hardware OAM, buffers, flags, and jobs while Yellow
owns that lifecycle. Evidence records a preceding map-to-Yellow edge and its
last map generation only when source plus built-ROM evidence proves that
predecessor; initial new-game, continue, reset, and other Yellow-owned entry
lifecycles never invent a departure. Evidence then records
map/tileset/override identity; viewport, scroll, window, and destination;
required tiles, animation, and replacements; every presentable bank-0 tilemap
and freshly generated bank-1 attribute; base, transformed, and hardware
palettes; player, follower, and object shadow OAM; current-generation
scheduler state; restored banks, stack, and interrupts; the single
presentation barrier; and five consecutive `OVERWORLD_ACTIVE` frames.

## Exhaustive production policy matrix

`CHK-SELECT-01` expands the complete Cartesian product `{COLOR, YELLOW}` ×
`{ordinary map presentation, overlay, dialogue, menu, battle, standalone,
boot/reset}` × `{each of 34 supported OVERWORLD maps, each of 162 supported
interior maps, unsupported map}`. Only cells combining `COLOR` with ordinary presentation of
one of those 196 supported maps select `RENDERER_FULL_COLOR_OVERWORLD`; every
other cell selects `RENDERER_YELLOW`. Each row asserts one and only one owner.
Executing and retaining this expanded harness matrix is deferred and is not
claimed by the current slice. `CHK-SELECT-02` additionally proves
that preference writes touch no video, renderer, generation, queue, palette,
VRAM, OAM, or hardware state and that policy is recomputed before the first
destination owner-gated writer.

## Overlay precedence matrix

This matrix remains conformance evidence for the quarantined/audit oracle; it
does not make a production Color overlay reachable. Production overlay,
dialogue, and menu scenes are instead covered as Yellow baseline plus complete
Color-to-Yellow and optional Yellow-to-Color return evidence by
`CHK-PROD-01`, `CHK-HANDOFF-01`, and `CHK-REGRESS-01`.

world-coordinate origin/transform, complete override set, classification,
desired tile ID, and explicit attribute or text/window default. The harness
clips the selected destination while retaining source-to-destination tilemap
and source-to-world mappings. Revealed terrain uses the supplied
world-coordinate override or supplied tileset lookup. Reading either VRAM bank
or ambient active-map state to derive classification, coordinate, tile
identity, or an expected attribute fails `CHK-OVERLAY-01`.

| Case key | Destination/clipping | Classification and source | Meaningful byte coverage | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OVERLAY-ORDINARY-OPAQUE-EXPLICIT | ordinary/unclipped | `OPAQUE_OVERLAY`, explicit full byte | palette 0–2, bank 3, flips 5–6, priority 7, bit 4 forced zero | request, coordinate map, expected/actual bytes |
| OVERLAY-ORDINARY-OPAQUE-DEFAULT | ordinary/unclipped | `OPAQUE_OVERLAY`, text/window default | default full byte and bit 4 forced zero | request, default key, expected/actual bytes |
| OVERLAY-ORDINARY-REVEALED-LOOKUP | ordinary/unclipped | `REVEALED_TERRAIN`, desired tile lookup | palette 0–2, bank 3, flips 5–6, priority 7, bit 4 forced zero | tile ID, lookup entry, expected/actual bytes |
| OVERLAY-ORDINARY-REVEALED-OVERRIDE | ordinary/unclipped | `REVEALED_TERRAIN`, coordinate override | override precedence and bit 4 forced zero | source/destination coordinate, override, bytes |
| OVERLAY-FULLY-CLIPPED | declared BG destination and Pallet Town/Overworld identity; empty after clipping | alternating opaque/revealed cells exercising explicit/default/override/lookup | no surviving commit cell; every source branch structurally proven | clipped coordinate map, precedence proof, and zero-entry trace with canonical non-writing `WR-NONE` allowlist |
| OVERLAY-PARTIALLY-CLIPPED | declared destination per edge and Pallet Town/Overworld identity; clipped on each destination edge | alternating opaque/revealed cells exercising explicit/default/override/lookup | preserved source/destination/world mappings and every meaningful bit | pre/post clip tilemap/world map, precedence proof, and byte diffs |
| OVERLAY-MAP-EDGE | map edge | mixed explicit/default/lookup/override cells | every meaningful bit and canonical bit 4 | concrete mutation/writer IDs and byte diffs |
| OVERLAY-CONNECTION | Route 1 northwest `(0,0)` connection destination with canonical Overworld tileset | mixed explicit/default/lookup/override cells | every meaningful bit and canonical bit 4 | concrete mutation/writer IDs and byte diffs |
| OVERLAY-WINDOW | fully in-bounds Pallet Town/Overworld request to window map 9C00 | opaque and revealed cells | text/window default and terrain precedence; nonempty writer and complete commit | concrete mutation/writer/commit IDs and byte diffs |
| OVERLAY-ALTERNATE-BG | fully in-bounds Pallet Town/Overworld request to BG map 9C00 | opaque and revealed cells | destination pairing and every meaningful bit; nonempty writer and complete commit | concrete mutation/writer/commit IDs and byte diffs |
| OVERLAY-ALTERNATE-MAP | fully in-bounds Viridian City/Overworld request to BG map 9800 | opaque and revealed cells | supplied canonical destination, map/tileset identity, world transform, overrides, and lookup independent of ambient map; nonempty writer and complete commit | complete request, concrete mutation/writer/commit IDs, coordinate maps, and byte diffs |

## OAM fallback and lifecycle matrix

Palette mapping runs after final tile and Pikachu-offset selection and may
replace bits 0–2 only. Every case preserves bits 3–7. Diagnostic fallback
evidence is mandatory for invalid identities; release builds exclude
debug-only recording without changing the deterministic palette-0 result.

| Case key | Final picture identity | Expected palette | Required diagnostic evidence | Check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OAM-FALLBACK-MISSING | absent identity | OBJ palette 0 | fallback kind, object, final tile, generation, writer ID | CHK-OAM-01 |
| OAM-FALLBACK-RANGE | out-of-range identity | OBJ palette 0 | fallback kind, numeric identity, object, generation, writer ID | CHK-OAM-01 |
| OAM-FALLBACK-UNMAPPED | in-range unmapped identity | OBJ palette 0 | fallback kind, numeric identity, object, generation, writer ID | CHK-OAM-01 |
| OAM-MAPPED-OBJECTS | every mapped final identity | deliberate mapped OBJ palette | mapping key and concrete shadow/hardware writer IDs | CHK-OAM-02 |
| OAM-DMA-COMPLETE | maximum declared shadow batch | mapped and fallback results retained | shadow batch ID, DMA source/launch/wait IDs, complete hardware image | CHK-OAM-02, CHK-COMMIT-01 |

## Inventory-keyed implementation matrices

Phase 0 supplies the initial map-entry rows. Each implementation phase declares
and closes the rows for the paths it touches before those changes become
reachable. Each full-tier matrix is generated from the union of closed slices,
never by substituting a representative category:

- every concrete Color-owned `MU-…` row for Pallet Town/Route 1 load, reload, return, reconstruction,
  horizontal and vertical scrolling, four connection directions,
  third-screen, row, column, rectangle, alternate destination,
  animation, field replacement, moving BG, LCD-off load, palette dependency,
  and OAM participation is exercised by `CHK-TRANSFER-01`,
  `CHK-COMMIT-01`, or `CHK-OAM-02` as its declared resources require;
- every concrete `WR-…` row reached by those mutations is asserted against its
  owner, phase, generation, destination, commit unit, and bank permissions by
  `CHK-OWN-01`, `CHK-BANK-01`, and `CHK-INV-01`; and
- every concrete `SC-…` lifecycle and directed transition row is exercised on
  boot, normal, abnormal, Yellow-to-Yellow nested/error, reset, and failure
  exits by `CHK-HANDOFF-01` and `CHK-REGRESS-01`; `CHK-RETURN-01` joins only
  actual Yellow-to-Color eligible-map boundary rows.

The bounded production content matrix is specified for all 34 supported
`OVERWORLD` maps and the 162 maps using the 19 admitted interior tilesets,
including first entry, each actual Yellow-to-Color return, both scroll axes,
connections where present, and reload. Dialogue and menus remain Yellow
baseline cases with complete departure/return evidence. Execution of this
expanded harness matrix is deferred and is not claimed by the current slice;
authoring for the remaining tilesets also remains future work.

The full OAM matrix covers player walking, running, biking, surfing, fishing,
and ledge states; follower Pikachu in every direction and animation state;
maximum visible NPC population; static NPCs and item balls; cut tree and
boulder movement; dust/smoke; healing machine; emotion bubbles; and objects
under grass/priority tiles. Evidence includes shadow OAM, hardware OAM, OBJ
palettes, and multi-frame images.

## Completion report

The final implementation PR reports all concrete mapped IDs and includes:

- reproducible release, debug, and VC builds plus CGB-only header evidence;
- closed hardware-writer, scene, and mutation inventories;
- bank-stress and ownership-model results;
- complete named numeric cycle equations, exact-fit cases, and threshold-plus-one results for every selector-activated operation;
- architecture stress results;
- the exhaustive preference × lifecycle × map owner matrix, exact Pallet/Route 1 Color scope, forced-Yellow baseline coverage, complete bidirectional/reset handoffs, and Color-owned animation/field-replacement units;
- LLM-reviewed screenshots, frame strips, and contact sheets linked to
  semantic snapshots and traces;
- emulator and hardware/tool versions; and
- physical CGB tests not performed.
